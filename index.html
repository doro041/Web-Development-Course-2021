    <p class="intro">Shumen (Bulgarian: Шумен, also romanized as Shoumen or Šumen, pronounced  is the tenth largest city in Bulgaria and the administrative and economic capital of Shumen Province. Shumen is one of the oldest towns in Bulgaria. People inhabited the area for more than 3200 years. The town is situated in a picturesque valley in Northeastern Bulgaria.

During the period of the first Bulgarian Kingdom, Shumen entered the system of the Old Bulgarian fortresses, guarding the entrances to the capitals of Pliska and Preslav, as an impressive Bulgarian stronghold. During the period of the second Bulgarian Kingdom (XII-XIV c.), it turned into a true medieval town and a significant economical, trade and cultural centre with well developed crafts.

During the first centuries of the Ottoman rule Shumen was an administrative and military centre having public buildings and numerous craft and commercial shops. In 1851 the first Bugarian Orchestra and Opera were found here and in 1856 was given the first theatre performance. In Shoumen Sava Dobroplodni established the first class Girls’ School. Remarkable for their architecture are the houses from the Renaissance, in one of them used to live the leader of the Hungarian Revolution L. Koshut. The first brewery in Bulgaria which produces the best light bear in the country was built here.

Places of interest are the Monument”1300 years Bulgaria”, the fortress of Shoumen, the natural park of “Kyoshka”. Few kilometers away from the city is situated the unique the rock relief called “Madarski Konnik”.

      <h3>Shumen Name</h3>
      <p>The city was first mentioned as Šimeonis in 1153 by the Arab traveler Idrisi. The name is probably from Bulgarian shuma '(deciduous forest).'[2] Some believe Konstantin Jireček[citation needed] that it comes from the name of the Bulgarian emperor Simeon the Great. In the following periods, the city was mentioned with variants, such as Şumena, Şumna, Şumular, Sumunum, Şumnu and Şumen. The eleventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica lists it as Shumla,[3] similar to the way it lists Pleven as Plevna. </p>

      <h3>Geography</h3>
      <p>The city lies 80 kilometres (50 miles) west of Varna and is built within a cluster of hills, northern outliers of the eastern Balkans, which curve around it on the west and south in the shape of a horseshoe.[3] A rugged ravine intersects the ground longitudinally in the horseshoe ridge.[3]

        From Shumen roads radiate northwards to the Danubian cities of Rousse and Silistra and to Dobruja, southwards to the passes of the Balkans, and eastwards to Varna and Balchik.[3] </p>
